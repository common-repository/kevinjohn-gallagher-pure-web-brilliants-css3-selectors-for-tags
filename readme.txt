Adds classes to <p> tags to allow child node selection without CSS3.


== Information ==

Adds the following classes to paragraph tags:

* 	paragraph-last
* 	paragraph-number-X (e.g. paragraph-number-1)
* 	first-p-since-a-heading

This allows for CSS2.1 rules to mimic CSS3 selectors for backward and mobile compatibility.

* 	use "paragraph-number-X" instead of "p:first-child"
* 	use "paragraph-last" instead of "p:last-child"
